# Trichromatic advantage in wild primates

This repository contains all analysis code used for the capuchin color vision project.

The manuscript is titled:

**Color vision affects rates of fruit consumption in wild white-faced capuchin monkeys (*Cebus capucinus imitator*), especially among juveniles**

All code consists of a single script:

* capuchin.R

The script requires two input files containing data from the Santa Rosa Capuchin Project's database. These files are located in:

* data/CapuchinForagingData.txt

	A table with rows consisting of feeding events and associated metadata on the behavioral state, the feeding bout, the animal subject, and the feeding patch (including its phenological conditions).

* data/FruitColoration.txt

	A table with rows consisting of fruit resources utilized by Santa Rosa capuchin monkeys and associated taxonomic and color metadata.
